# üöÄ REAP Roadmap

`reap` is a modern, async-first AUR helper written in Rust, built to replace tools like `yay` and `paru` ‚Äî with better performance, extensibility, and a clean CLI/TUI experience.

---

## ‚úÖ v0.5.0 Completed Features
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Profile Package Management**: Switch between developer, gaming, minimal profiles with different backend priorities and settings
- ‚úÖ **Package Verification & Trust Scoring**: Real-time security analysis with trust badges (üõ°Ô∏è TRUSTED, ‚ö†Ô∏è CAUTION, ‚ùå UNSAFE)
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced TUI with Live Monitoring**: Real-time build progress, trust scores in search results, system stats dashboard
- ‚úÖ **Profile-Aware Installation**: Install behavior adapts to active profile (strict signatures, parallel jobs, backend order)
- ‚úÖ **Security Analytics**: Vulnerability scanning, PKGBUILD analysis, publisher verification
- ‚úÖ **Advanced UI Components**: Progress bars, trust badges, profile switcher, system monitoring
- ‚úÖ **Manual PKGBUILD retrieval from AUR**: Fetch, parse, and analyze PKGBUILDs
- ‚úÖ **Dependency resolution and conflict detection**: Advanced circular dependency and conflict analysis
- ‚úÖ **Interactive prompts**: Confirm removals, edit PKGBUILDs with safety checks
- ‚úÖ **Interactive `--diff` for PKGBUILDs**: TUI/CLI diff viewer with colored output
- ‚úÖ **Package list, queue manager, and PKGBUILD diff viewer in TUI**: Comprehensive package management interface

## üÜï v0.4.0 Highlights  
- Refactored `resolve_and_install_deps` to use dynamic package lists and proper async return types
- Fully implemented recursive AUR + repo dependency resolution with deduplication
- `pkgb` now parsed and printed via `parse_pkgname_ver` to eliminate unused variable warnings
- Fixed Clippy-critical errors (E0308, E0271) blocking build; reduced total warnings significantly
- Updated core.rs to use clean `Box::pin(async move { ... })` with correct `Result<(), ()>` wrapping

## üÜï v0.3.0-rc Highlights
- End-to-end async/parallel install and upgrade flows (no yay/paru fallback)
- GPG workflows: refresh, import, verify, check key, set keyserver (with clear feedback)
- Flatpak install/upgrade fully integrated
- Shell-based hooks for all lifecycle events (pre_install, post_install, etc.)
- Minimal rollback support: restores PKGBUILD or cleans up failed install dirs
- Improved error handling and logging throughout
- Docs and tests for config, GPG, hooks, Flatpak, rollback

- [x] `reap --tui` ‚Äì launches the async TUI (stub or basic UI).
- [x] `reap --pin` ‚Äì pins packages to exclude from upgrades.
- [x] `reap --clean` ‚Äì cleans cache or temp files.
- [x] `reap doctor` ‚Äì performs basic health check and config audit.
- [x] CLI integration for all GPG subcommands (import, show, verify, check, set-keyserver)
- [x] Tap-based source support (add/list remote AUR repos)
- [x] Full CLI wiring for Flatpak backend (search, install, upgrade, audit)
- [x] Implemented `handle_search()` and wired AUR search subcommand
- [x] `reap doctor` now provides async config validation
- [x] `reap backup` ‚Äì backs up config from `~/.config/reap` to `/var/lib/reaper/backups/config/`
- [x] Short flag cleanup ‚Äì resolved CLI flag conflicts for `-S`, `-Q`, `-U`, etc.
- [x] Backup and rollback scaffolding (`utils::backup_config`, `rollback_pkgbuild`)
- [x] Documentation for secure tap publishing (PUBLISHING.md)
