# REAPER TODOs

# All major TODOs are now tracked in ROADMAP.md and inline code comments.
# See ROADMAP.md for v0.4/v1.0 priorities and feature status.
# All install/upgrade logic is now async/parallel and native Rust (no yay/paru fallback).
# CLI and TUI support for rollback, pin, audit, tap management, and more is complete for v0.3.0.


# Unused Variable TODOs: Unused variable for future implementation:
#   _result
